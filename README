testing hg-git specifically bookmarking and branching workflow

testing my new laptop hg and hg-git settings

testing hg-git at work, using existing ssh key made with openssh/git (didn't work!)

changing my mercurial.ini to use git's ssh.exe, (didn't work!) have to stick with pageant. :(

testing the hg-git bookmarking workflow again, i don't use it enough to remember
